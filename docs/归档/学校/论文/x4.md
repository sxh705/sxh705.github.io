I. INTRODUCTION
Spring boot is one of the spring module fra mewo rks which
provides Rapid Application Development (RAD) functionality
built on top of the popular Java Spring Fra mewo rk to provide
quick and fast access to informat ion in do ing a project. Setting
up the RAD is quite eas y to configure and run web-based and
enterprise developments using Java. The most significant
thing about this framework is that we can just run the
application as it requires very minima l spring configuration,
ma king developing standalone spring-based applications a lot
easier. Embedded Servers and the Spring Fra me work modules
are used by Spring Boot for its operational purpose. Also, in
spring, it is not required to configure XML.		integration with other Java fra me works such as JPA/Hibernate
ORM, Struts, and so forth. The development of the application
takes less time and costs less. The dependencies in a project
add Spring Boot annotations to configure the application
automatically. For instance, the MySQL database is on the
class path, and we haven’t yet configured the database
connection, but spring boot s ets up an in -me mory database for
us.
II. RELATED WORKS
 [1] developed a web application towards public co mpla int
service using spring boot-microservices architecture. These
microservices architecture are used to s plit the functionality
based on the corporate process. These services are
interconnected to each other, resulting in a co mplete business
process in a single application.
 In [2], a person-hour managing informat ion system using
spring boot framework is introduced. This system is used to
process, analyze, and identify the person-hour workflow
problems over industrial and assembly-based service
companies. An in-depth analysis is done based on why spring
boot is selected for this research purpose.
[3] discussed how the internet technology applications can
be used under government sectors through spring boot
supported technologies. It also outlines how these applications
can be more effective in problem-solving comp le x
manage ment processes with low-efficiency work e xecution.
This paper proposes a customized spring boot fra me work to
adopt the concept of micro-services architecture and other
integrated Mybatis, Redis technologies used within the spring
framework.
 It follows the software design paradigm of convention over
configuration. In simp le words, the efforts of the developer are
minimalized. Starting a spring boot project has been made so
easy that we can directly use Spring In itia lize r. Genera lly,
spring provides features such as dependency injection,
powerful database transaction management, and simplified		 According to [4], using the spring boot platform, you
can keep up to date with the latest economic and policy
news and information in the Be lt and Road regions. A

 Object-oriented programming and software engineering
techniques are applied to describe the civ il aircraft structural
strength materia ls performance database systems [5]. As a
starting point, the management scope and input data
standards for the materia l libra ry are defined; Material
informat ion for metals, co mposites, and layup is classified
and managed based on its use.		III. TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS
 The technological development towards the spring boot is
focused on five stages ofdevelopment.
A. Research Initiative Differences
Recent research initiatives using spring boots are listed. Many
other technologies and methodologies are bound with spring
boots to observe the benefits to develop an efficient system.
 A simp le demonstration in [6] using Java Message
Service (JMS) he lps us understand how the clients work and
are configured under the spring boot framework. A lso, JMS
is considered part of message-oriented middlewa re for
sending mes s ages between two or more clients at a
particular time interval T.
 Furthermore, the author of [7] has discussed the workings
of Advanced Messaging Queuing Protocol (AMQP), an
agnostic messaging protocol. This AMQP is often used in the
financial sector and other financial applications. In t ime, the
e xtension of VMware/Pivotal has acquired its working
process by embedding it with the Erlang programming
language. Thus, the programming language of RabbitMQ was
born with unique functionality.
 Nowadays, Cloud Co mputing is one of the most in-
demand and significant concepts in the Informat ion
Technology (IT) industry [8]. Apps and architectures based
on "Cloud-Native" concepts are gaining popularity because
they allow developers to more easily follow patterns that
provide speed, scalability, and security. An alternative
mechanis m is used similar to the existing technique, i.e., the
Maven command, wh ich allows the creation of standalone
applications [9]. Using a container for e xterna l applications,
we can create WARs from web applications.
Spring Boot provides an Actuator module that gives
various non-functional requirements to our application ready
to go into production. The authors of [10] have done a detailed
study about the usage of the Spring Actuator module and give
a gist of how to use the features provided to monitor Spring
Boot applications. In general, after deployment, developers
check the logs to ensure correctness and check for bugs.
CRUDy Leaf, a DSL (Do ma in -Specific Language), e xtends
the DSL programming languages used to develop and design
in such a way based on the problem that occurred in
addressing domain with n nu mber of alternative solutions
[11]. Also, for CRUD entity operations, the spring boot
fra me work uses an e xternal API known as “ REST” for
generating CRUDyLeaf entries in the database.		 Web Service integration through AI (Artificial
 Intelligence to use predication algorithms on various
 applications [13].
 Oak Ridge National Laboratory's ARM Data Center
 (ADC) uses Spring Boot to create a REST-based SOA-
 based API that bridges the front-end user interface with
 the back-end database. Us ers of the ARM platform can
 now s ubmit reports by either using the user foru m or by
 using the REST service API, which collects the s ame
 data quality informat ion about ARM data as stated in
 [14].
 Using Microservices and Spring Boot, we develop a
 backend application for public complaint s ys tems were
 proposed in [1]. A web browser can be used to access
 the cloud-based application. It can also be added more
 microservices without affecting others , which is an
 advantage of this architecture.
 Model and Vie w separation on an application through
 many technologies for a warehouse management system
 is proposed [15]. The design towards front-end us es
 Angular JS and bootstrap. In contrast, the back end
 utilizes Java with spring boot to form the business logic
 and data processing.
B. Feature Comparison
 The feature comparison of the spring boot towards the
exis ting mechanism is explained as follows,
 Spring Boot reduces the cluttering in our project. Unlike
 other frameworks for building RESTful Web services,
 Spring Boot stands apart because of its unique features.
 Spring Security which adds a protective layer that is
 more secure than typical JSON Web Token (JWT) used
 in Node JS etc.,
 Having a Java framework, Spring boot has the
 advantage of being multithreaded. So, for building
 backends that are required to support a huge amount of
 data significant in today’s era, Spring Boot can easily
 stand apart from otherframeworks.
C. Technology Differences
 Web applications hold a significant and key ro le a mong
applications powering these businesses [12]. There is a need
to build robust s ervers and applications to support a rapidly
increasing user base. In this paper, we discuss how we can		 The technology differences used in spring boot and
outcomes are discussed as follows,

 Spring Boot is bas ed on the Spring framework and us es
Java language.
 It varies with other fra me works like NodeJS, Django,
 Php etc. But when it comes to light weighted and more
 scalable solutions,NodeJs can be a better fit.
 Using Java which is a multithreaded language, Spring
Boot has an extra edge here over NodeJS.
D. Merits and demerits over the genre of application
 Spring Boot can handle huge amounts of data, can be
used especially in the Big Data industry.
 When it comes to being lightweight and more robust,
 Spring Boot has many dependencies that make it a
 heavy application.
 A lot of configuration has to be done for all the
 dependencies and is not so s imple compared to NodeJs
 etc.
 Spring boot is very simp le for building RestFul Web
 services and APIs, ma king it simp ler for the developer
 to complete the job.
 De merits include a lack of control and flexibility in
 projects.
 Also, we can find bloated JAR’s, i.e., many unused
 dependencies, which s ometimes makes them unsuitable
 for large-scale projects.
E. Highlights of Spring Boot		 Actuator - Using the actuator, you can see what's going
on in a running Spring Boot application. The application
provides a lot of metrics and insight about how
applications are running in production. For exa mple,
using an actuator lets you determine the ex By using an
actuator, you can determine the exact beans and
configuration used in an application context, make
decisions based on auto-configuration, see what
environment variables, s ys tem properties, and
command-line arguments are available to an
application, and many other things. Spring Actuator
addresses the problem of not knowing what is inside
your application with all its auto-configuration
goodness.
 Spring Boot Initia lize r - Spring Boot's initializer solves
 the problem of pro ject structure with another feature
 called Spring Initializer. Maven or Gradle can be
 generated from the website using Java, Kotlin, Groovy,
 or Spring Boot. Project Metadata is all that needs to be
 provided, such as name, group, artifact, etc.
 Additionally, a variety of starter dependencies can be
 selected,such as web, JPA, and security.
F. Tools
 Some of the tools supporting the spring boot are expla ined
and listed as follows,
 Gradle - An IDE to support software development
 under multiple languages. It focuses on the product,
 testing and publishing.
	 AutoConfiguration - You can automatically configure
 specific c lasses if it detects their presence in the class
 path. For e xa mple, Spring Boot automatically creates an
 in-me mory database for you and a ready-to-use JDBC
 Template when you add the JDBC Te mplate to your
 class path and include the H2.jar. To use the JDBC
 Template in a DAO layer, you do not need to write the
 above code.		 Maven – A tool handles projects written us ing C#,
Ruby, Scala and so on.
 IntelliJ – A co mmerc ial development tool written in
 JA VA language. It provides coding assistance, built-in
 tool integration, plugin ecosystem, 28+ language
 supports.
 JMeter – A testing software added as a plugin to spring
 boot to measure various services’performance.
	 Starter POMs - By identifying and adding common
 dependencies to the project, the starter POMs re move
 the pain. The minimu m number of dependencies that
 need to be incorporated in order to build a s imple
 Spring MVC-based REST application and run it in an
 embedded container is seven. All of these can be found
 by adding spring-boot-starter-web dependency in your
 pom.xml using Spring Boot starter packages or starter
 dependencies.		 Mockito - Test-driven development and behavior-driven
 development can both be conducted with double test
 objects created in the framework.
 Live Reload – A browser e xtension used to support CLI
application and server programs through APIs.
G. Companies that support the technology
	 Spring Boot CLI - In order to create Spring-based web
 applications using Groovy programming, you can use
 the Spring Boot CLI, a command-line interface pro
 vided by the Spring Boot framework. Spring Boot and
Groovy go well together. Java developers benefit from
Groovy's s implic ity, while Spring developers benefit
from the simplicity of Spring Boot.		 Netflix
 Google
 PayPal
 Discover Financial Services
 United Health group
 Wells Fargo

IV. CONCLUSION
Figure 1 Working Architecture of Spring Boot
 The validator c lass, the view c lass, and the utility class are
now available. Using all the Spring-like modules, such as
Spring M VC, Sp ring Data, etc., Spring Boot uses them all.
There is only one difference between Spring Boot and Spring
MVC: Spring Boot does not require DAO and DAOImp l
classes. CRUD operations are performed on a data access
layer. HTTP requests are made by the client (PUT or GET).
Controllers map requests and handle them. Requests are sent
to them and are handled by them. If required, it then invokes
the service logic. The business logic is performed in the
service layer. The model classes map data to JPA and perform
logic on it. The user is returned a JSP page if there are no
errors.		 Spring boot is one of the most us ed and popular
fra me works worldwide to develop ready to use enterprise-
level applications in Java. It can be used to formulate Restful
Webservices and API mo re simp ly and reduce the developer’s
efforts by avoiding all the boilerplate code. It is very useful
and appropriate, especially for a huge a mount of data and
processing. W hile other competitors like NodeJS are faster,
it’s s till ineffective due to its security features, especially in
the banking sector. As per analysis, 24% of the market was
affected directly by spring boot and 41 % indirectly by spring
supported services. It is better to understand the dema nd and
supply of the IT industry to diversify our research focus.
