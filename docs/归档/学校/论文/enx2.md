1. Introduction With the continuous acceleration of China's urbanization process, the increase of residents' income, and the rapid promotion of smart cities and urbanization, the service demand of property owners no longer stays at the traditional property service levels such as sanitation, environmental greening, equipment, facilities and order maintenance, but increases the demand for personalized extension services.
Property management refers to the management of various houses, ancillary facilities and sites put into use after completion acceptance by specialized agencies and personnel in accordance with the contract and agreement. At the same time, professional management will be carried out for the surrounding environment, sanitation, public green space,facilities and equipment maintenance of the community to provide residents with comprehensive services in all aspects.
With the rapid development of information technology,building a community O2O platform by using mobile Internet,cloud computing, big data and other means to improve the service efficiency of property management has become an indispensable part of modern community property management and services, helping community management move towards a new service model that is more efficient,convenient and user-friendly [1]. Traditional property management mainly relies on a large number of manpower in daily work scenarios such as charging, visitor registration,and data statistics. Service efficiency is low. Service response and progress feedback such as owner's repair request are not timely. Access control, road gates and other facilities and equipment have poor compatibility with the platform [2]. It is unable to interconnect and share data, forming an information island. Therefore, based on big data technology, WeChat mini program interface and the mainstream technical framework [3]
in recent years, we developed a smart property managementsystem to achieve the integration of various propertyinformation management needs such as payment andcharging, work order repair, owner complaint communication,information release, access control and anti-theft through the latest technical means, forming a smart property servicemanagement application technology platform, Only in thisway can we effectively improve and enhance the dailybusiness operation efficiency of the property serviceenterprises, and ensure that the property service enterprisesachieve the scientific management objectives andstandardized management objectives. In recent years, China'sinformatization level has been constantly improved, but mostof the property management systems are less intelligent. Theystill rely heavily on traditional manual input methods tomanage and process residential properties. The integration ofterminal equipment related to properties is not high, and theefficiency needs to be improved. On the other hand, most ofthe property systems have a low degree of interaction or lackconvenient communication channels, and communityproperty managers lack communication with communityowners.
2. Design of Property Management Information System Based on Spring Boot The Spring Boot framework is a product of the maturedevelopment of the Spring framework. The Spring Bootframework can make Spring programs run faster, reduce theconfiguration files for writing programs as much as possible,and make it easier to create independent, production basedapplications [4]. Therefore, we choose to use the microserviceframework Spring Boot to develop the intelligent propertymanagement system. By using microservices, we can achieveloose coupling of each microservice. Each microservice onlyfocuses on one task. These small micro services can becombined to form a more powerful system. The systemdeveloped with microservice architecture has the advantagesof easy testing, strong scalability, easy system iteration, etc. Itcan reduce the development cost of community propertymanagement system, shorten the development cycle, andimprove team efficiency. In terms of data storage, multipledatabases can be selected, such as Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft163
SQL server, etc. Front end development frameworks includeAngular, React, Vue [5], etc. Through demand analysis, thesystem decided to adopt B/S architecture, MVVM (ModelView View Model) mode [6], Vue framework [7] for the frontend, Spring Boot framework for the back end, and MYSQLfor the database development. Through MVVM development mode, the system can realize the separation of front-end andback-end. The front-end only needs to call the interfaceprovided by the back-end to call the data. Like MVC mode[8], MVVM mode has the advantages of low coupling,independent development and testability.
Figure 1. The "MVVM" Mode Architecture2.1. System function analysis Through the analysis of the property management systemof the community, the project has built an effective systemintegrating information management, property office,property and owner information interaction, simplifying dailyproperty management work, improving property managementefficiency, and making the communication between propertyand owner more real-time and convenient. The systemrealizes the business process of traditional property throughonline and mobile terminals. For example, the functions forowners and property enterprises include onlinecommunication, online announcement, online repair report,online complaint, online voting, satisfaction survey, etc. Each module has strong flexibility and scalability, and each moduleis relatively independent, but data and permissions can beinterconnected.
2.2. Overall system design The system adopts B/S architecture, and the communityproperty management system adopts B/S architecture, whichcan logically divide the whole system into three layers: Webclient, Web server, and database server; The three-layerstructure should not only complete its own functions but alsobe connected with adjacent layers. Under the B/S architecture,the basic architecture of the management system is shown inFigure 2.
Figure 2. Basic Structure of Property Management System2.3. System database design To meet the functional requirements of the system,conceptual model (ER model) and relational data model are designed through requirements analysis. Take the administrator as an example, the administrator is the main operator of the property management system of the community, and they mainly provide convenient services for the owners of the community. The administrator needs to handle the core business of the community, such as propertymanagement and parking fee management. Manage theparking spaces in the community, determine the ownership ofthe parking spaces, and point out which parking spaces are tobe sold or have been sold. The property manager should be able to count the property fee collection of the owners of thecommunity, and classify the owners who have paid and havenot paid. For basic businesses, such as equipmentmanagement, complaint management, maintenancemanagement, building management and other propertymanagers can complete basic data recording and modification.
To sum up, the use case diagram of property manager isshown in Figure 3.

number, password, telephone and address. The Owner's E-R diagram is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5. The E-R Diagram of Owner On the basis of conceptual design, the overall E-R diagram of the system is obtained according to the design, and the entities in the E-R diagram, the attributes of entities, and the relationships between entities are transformed into relational patterns. The partially transformed relationship mode is as follows:
Figure 3. Use Case Diagram of Property Manager Through the discussion and analysis of demand analysis,confirm the relevant entities included in the communityproperty management system. Take the administrator and theowner entity as an example, the administrator entity has theattributes of administrator ID, account number, password andtelephone. The administrator E-R diagram is shown in Figure4. Resident (owner ID, account number, name, address,contact information)
Water meter (meter number, owner number, name,payment or not, number of water meters in this month,payment date)
Electricity meter (meter number, owner number, name,payment or not, number of meters in this month, payment date)
Property management fee list (form number, owner number,name, whether to pay, property fee, payment date).
Through the analysis of the design requirements of theentire database, multiple data storage tables can be designedaccording to the entity relationship diagram, and each tablestores the corresponding specific information, as shown inTable 1 and Table 2.
Figure 4. The E-R Diagram of Property ManagerThe owner entity has the attributes of owner ID, account (1) User Table The user table is used to store the user information in thecommunity property management system. The field nameuserID represents the user ID, the field name usernamerepresents the user name, the field name password representsthe login password, and the field name power is used todetermine the user role when logging in, and the addressrepresents the residential address. The overall situation isshown in Table 1 below.

System Functions Realization The main relevant functional modules of the systeminclude administrator login, user login, resident informationmanagement, equipment repair, maintenance management,news information and notice management, parking spacemanagement, payment management and other modules. Now,the user registration login module and the accountmanagement module of background management areintroduced.
3.1. User registration and login authentication The mobile terminal is implemented with WeChat applet,which is faster and more convenient. The business logicprocessing is realized through Vue front-end framework andJavascript. The registration and login authentication processis as follows: The owner user needs to authorize WeChat personal information to log in when entering the system forthe first time. After successful login, users can enter the"Profile" interface to modify their personal information. Aftersuccessful login authentication, the applet will automaticallyjump to the home page.
3.2. Ledger management function module The ledger management function enables account openingand closing, automatic generation of management fees,shared expenses, offsetting prepaid expenses, bankwithholding, daily charges and other functions. It can also setthe bill template for the above items to achieve automaticcalculation and statistics of bills. The mobile terminal can alsoview the relevant bill data at any time, greatly improving themanagement efficiency of the property. Relevant interfacesare shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7.
